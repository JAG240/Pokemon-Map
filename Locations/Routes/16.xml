    <des>Like Route 18 at the southern end of <pref>Cycling Road</pref>, Route 16 runs directly
        east-west for its entire length. Five paces outside <pref>Celadon</pref>, a cuttable tree
        blocks a passage leading to the north half of Route 16. Several paces west of this spot,
        Route 16 narrows before widening just east of a gate. In this station, <pers>Trainers</pers>
        are forced to board their <item>Bicycle</item> or, in the event that they do not own a
            <item>Bicycle</item>, are forced to return east to <pref>Celadon</pref>.</des>
