            pass through to Route 2 until he has had his daily coffee. The man is
            simply a barrier in the game, preventing players from wandering past Viridian
            City until the player has gone to the Viridian Poke Mart and
            delivered Oak's Parcel to Professor Oak.The Viridian Gym is the official Gym of Viridian City.
            Trainers who defeat this Gym's Leader receive the Earth Badge. The Gym
            is usually strewn with the same one-way spin tiles seen in the Team Rocket
            Hideout.The man in the area that requires Cut or Surf to access
            gives out the TM for Dream Eater
