         <img alt="Lavender Town" src="../Images/Lavender Town.png"></img>
         <p>A small town covered in a beautiful hue of purple. Pokemon Tower is a seven-floor graveyard that holds the grave of
            departed Pokemon. On all seven floors, the tower houses hundreds of graves of
            deceased Pokemon. Many people visit the building daily to pay their respects to the
            fallen. On all floors other than the first two, though, the possibility of being
            attacked by wild Pokemon is present. Populated by Channelers, it was
            notable for numerous ghost sightings (Pokemon killed by Team Rocket),
            as well as the location of Team Rocket's kidnapping of Mr.
            Fuji. Although players can encounter Ghost-type Pokemon here, they can
            not be seen or captured unless they have a Silph Scope.  The tower was converted to the Kanto Radio Tower, with all graves
            being moved to either the House of Memories or underground. The new
            House of Memories is placed where the Poke Mart has
            been before. The Kanto radio tower can be entered, like its Johto
            counterpart, but only the ground floor, as the upper floors are completely off
            limits. This was done to prevent a similar take over that was seen in Johto. Talking
            to the receptionist on the ground floor, the player can receive a Pokegear
            radio card for Kanto.  The Lavender Volunteer Pokemon House located in central
            Lavender Town, was founded by Mr. Fuji in order to
            care for abandoned and orphaned Pokemon. Many members of the organization live in
            the safe house, looking after the abandoned Pokemon. Many Pokemon have stayed at the
            Volunteer Pokemon House over time, including Psyduck, Nidorino, and after the
            Team Rocket attack on the Pokemon Tower, Cubone.
