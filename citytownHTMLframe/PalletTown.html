         <img alt="Pallet Town" src="../Images/Pallet Town.png"></img>
         <p>A fairly new and quiet town. It's a small and pretty place.In the southeast corner of town is Professor Oak's Lab. Here, Pokemon Trainers just
            beginning their quest are given the choice to receive either a Bulbasaur, Charmander,
            or Squirtle from Professor Oak. On the occasion that
            Professor Oak is out of the previously listed Pokemon, he has been seen to hand out
            Pikachu and Eevee. This is also the location of Red's first battle,
            which was against his rival, Blue.This house is where the player lives before beginning their journey.
            The player's Mom lives here, and after the player has left
            town for the first time, going home and talking to her will fully rest/restore all
            of the player's Pokemon, just like a Pokemon Center.After the Pokedex has been given to the player by Professor
            Oak, the rival's sister will give the player a
            Town Map.
