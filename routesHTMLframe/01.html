         <p>Heading north from Pallet Town, Trainers must make their way around a large but very
            primitive route, that will become their very first route they will explore on their
            journey.
            The route is riddled with large patches of tall grass, and ledges that contour from
            far east
            to all to the far west, blocking off most of the route making it hard to travel north,
            only
            to have small gaps by which the road has been broken into it. The Pok√© Mart assistant
